  problem: "While salespeople drive revenue by engaging directly with customers and understanding their needs, they often lack deep product knowledge due to their customer-facing role. Product Marketing Managers (PMMs), who own the product roadmap and feature development, possess this comprehensive product understanding. However, **the knowledge transfer between PMMs and sales teams is frequently inadequate**, resulting in standardized sales content that fails to address diverse customer requirements.** And thus causes the loss of deals.",

    "For Sales team, Proponent extract key insights and action items for each valuable customer call, delivering timely, relevant information that enhances every customer engagement. By leveraging the PMM-curated product knowledge library (GTM hub), Proponent AI provides recommendations that actually drive results.",
    "For Marketing team, Proponent provides a knowledge library (GTM hub) that is easy to manage and maintain all the products, personas, and insights. Knowledge transfer between sales and marketing has never been easier. The hub also serves as an AI training ground, with the knowledge inputs, Proponent AI continuously learning about the products and personas to deliver increasingly accurate recommendations.",
  ],
  impact: "From high-level strategy, user flows, information architecture, visual design, marketing website, and demo video, I crafted Proponent's comprehensive product vision. Together with PM and engineering, we successfully launched the product in six months, receiving positive market response, got accepted to incubators, and the design itself is awarded multiple times.",

  legoBricks: {
    title: "Build the Lego bricks",
    intro: "One of the most significant lessons I learned while building this product from the ground up was the critical importance of systems design thinking. Initially, I approached each feature in isolation, focusing on individual key actions. However, I gradually discovered that scalable design requires a \"Lego brick\" approach—identifying versatile, reusable components that can be combined in different ways.",
    subtitle: "Key system components that emerged:",
    components: [
      "**Title-subtitle pattern:** I recognized that pairing a primary title with a secondary subtitle was widely applicable and essential, as we consistently needed that additional context layer—whether for insights, meetings, or other content areas.",
      "**Side panel (drawer) component:** Originally introduced for meetings to enable swift switching between meeting insights and summaries, this component proved so effective that we successfully adopted it across other areas, including insights panels and analytics panels.",
      "**Card-based layouts:** This concept was adopted later in the design process after I realized how effectively cards handled responsive design challenges and created cleaner, more hierarchical visuals that improved overall clarity."

    title: "Archived history",
    content: "Looking back is always a time to reflect and appreciate how far we've come. Everything started with casual mockups in Figma and evolved into what it is today through countless rounds of iterations and refinements. I'm confident it will continue to grow beyond what we've achieved so far. I'm deeply grateful for all the help and encouragement I've received along the way—especially those moments when I felt truly connected with the team, working together toward a shared vision that felt bigger.",
