        <div className="space-y-6">
          <p>I am a product designer with curiosity in the vast spectrum of design ‚Äî from the elegant forms of furniture to the visual allure of graphics and print, the storytelling power of photography, the artistry of gastronomy, and objects infused with personality.</p>
          <p>This multifaceted approach to design fuels my work in the digital realm. I aspire to create software experiences that resonate on a human level.</p>
          <p>Through a blend of aesthetics, functionality, and empathy, I create digital products that not only solve problems but enrich lives, leaving people inspired and eager to explore further.</p>

        <div className="space-y-6">
          <p>I built this site to transform my aversion to portfolio updates into a passion for continuous learning and sharing, creating a space I'm eager to revisit and enhance. By showcasing everything I'm passionate about to a broader audience, I strive to inspire others while holding myself accountable to high standards of creativity and growth.</p>
          <p>This site is curated with the same care and personality I'd put into decorating my home. It's a space that reflects who I am and what I do.</p>
          <p>I've always found it fascinating to get to know someone through a well-maintained personal website. So whether you are a stranger, a friend, or somewhere in between ‚Äì welcome. Make yourself comfortable in my digital home.</p>
